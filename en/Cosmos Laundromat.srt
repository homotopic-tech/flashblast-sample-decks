2
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,000
{{Excuse}} me, sir?

5
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Do you {{have}} a moment, sir?

6
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,050
I'm {{kind of}} in the middle of {{something}} here.

7
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,950
I've {{come}} a long way for you, Franck.

8
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
{{My name is}} Victor.

11
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,500
{{You are}} Franck.

12
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,000
You are so much {{more}} than just a sheep, {{aren't you}}?

13
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Oh yeah? How {{would}} you know?

14
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,900
Look at you. You're an {{adventurer}}, Franck.

15
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,000
Just {{like me}}, you're... a lone wolf.

16
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Tell me, does one choose to be {{alone}}?

18
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,600
One {{doesn’t}} even {{choose}} to be a wolf.

22
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don’t know {{what you’re on about}} but I'm {{just}} a sheep minding its own {{business}}.

23
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,600
And I {{suggest}} you {{do the same}}.

26
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,500
Just give me {{one minute}} of your precious {{time}}.

27
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,500
{{Precious}} time? Hehehe.

28
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,500
Yeah {{just}} give me one minute.

29
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,500
You would have {{one more}} minute, wouldn't you?

32
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,000
You will not {{regret}} this.

33
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The adventures you {{will}} have.

34
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,500
All the lives you've ever {{wanted}}.

35
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,700
All you’ve been {{missing}}.

36
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,000
Here. This is... the best {{product}} we have... in store.

37
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Variable spin {{speed}}, {{excellent}} tumble performance...

38
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
...in one... handy... {{device}}. Squeaky clean.

39
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Well this... this {{better}} be good.

40
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
{{Took me ages}} to {{tie}} that rope.

42
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
No more need for {{hooves}}.

43
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
{{No more}} sheepy business.

46
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,500
How does this thing {{work}}?

47
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,000
{{I mean}}, how do I {{make it}} work?

49
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,000
I just {{turned it on}} {{for you}}.

52
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
We will {{pick you up}}. Don't worry, just {{stay}} here.

53
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
In this {{exact}} place.
